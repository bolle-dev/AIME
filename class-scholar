			<p> For you, knowledge makes the Wild a less threatening place. Strangers become friends if addressed properly, yellowed maps in old books replace a fear of the unknown with curiosity and wonder of places you have yet to explore, songs composed in ages past strengthen the weariest of hearts. A love of learning guides your every step and illuminates the way for you and those who listen to your advice. </p>
			<p class="indent">A Scholar is always learned, always wise, but learning takes many forms. In civilised lands and civilised times, Scholars gather books of lore and pore over rustling parchments. In Wilderland, in rustic communities or in times of war and want, a Scholar might be a master of folk-lore and secrets passed from teacher to apprentice over long years.</p>
			<p class="indent">Many Scholars are also healers, for a knowledge of herblore and the healing arts is perhaps the most useful (and, some would say, most respectable) field of study.</p>
			<p class="indent">The most important thing to keep in mind when creating your Scholar is to think of where and how you gained your knowledge. Did you study under a master, learning as an apprentice? Is your Scholar a dabbler, flitting from one obsession to another, or do you learn all there is to know about one field of lore before moving on? Finally, why have you left your home to take on a dangerous life as an adventurer?</p>
			<h4>Play a Scholar if you want to...</h4>
			<p>Uncover ancient secrets and use their power against the Enemy.</p>
			<p class="indent">Be admitted into the councils of the Wise, and know much that is hidden.</p>
			<p class="indent">Master the art of healing and restore your injured friends to full health.</p>

				<p>If you can touch a creature, you may expend one Healing Die per action, instantly granting them hit points equal to 1d8 plus your wisdom modifier, up to their maximum. If instead you tend the creature for at least 10 minutes, binding their wounds, treating them with herbs and poultices, and offering soothing words, then you may multiply the 1d8 by your proficiency modifier. Then add your Wisdom modifier.</p>
				<p>Alternatively, you can spend a Healing Die to cure one disease, neutralize one poison, or remove one condition affecting a single target. Conditions are removed instantly, but poisons and diseases require the creature to take a long rest before they are removed.</p>
				<p>The types of conditions you can cure are limited when you first gain this feature. You can remove the Frightened, Paralysed, Stunned, or Unconscious conditions. At higher levels you can cure other conditions, described below.</p>

		<description>
			<p>You know many things that are hidden from most and tidings of distant events tend to reach you with astonishing speed. The source of your knowledge is obscure and you do not explain how you know the things you do to others – it is enough that what you know is true.</p>
			<p>At the start of each adventuring phase or after spending time in a Sanctuary, the Loremaster should inform you of one or two events of importance occurring somewhere in Wilderland.</p>
			<p>Scholars always know a little bit about everything and the Loremaster should regularly give you rumours or information based on your appropriate Passive ability checks. For more clarity you can always make an active ability check to learn more about a person, place, or event. Once per Adventuring Phase you can add +5 to one of these active ability checks.</p>

		<description> 
			<p>At 5th level, your insight and learning is sufficient to manipulate others with well-timed words (or theatrics and cheap tricks). At the start of any interaction, you may make an Intelligence (Insight) test against a DC of 15 + the target’s Wisdom modifier. If successful, then at any point in the conversation, you may gain advantage on any one skill check through your scholarship and preparation.</p>
			<p>You might, for example, make a cryptic reference to some secret known only to a few people, or remind the person you’re talking to about the deeds of their forefathers, or raise your staff to dramatically startle a flock of crows to underline your words. You might palm a firework, or arrive in just the nick of time.</p>

			<p>At 6th level, you find deeper meaning in the long history of Middle-earth. If you remind another Player-hero of a relevant tale from the history of their people, then that character gains one Scholarly Inspiration die, a d6, which they may use to add to any roll. Once you have used this feature, you cannot use it again until you have taken a long rest.</p>

	<element name="Hidden Paths" type="Class Feature" source="Willem" id="ID_WILLEM_AIME_CLASS_FEATURE_SCHOLAR_HIDDEN_PATHS">
		<description>
			<p>At 11th level, your mastery of lore is such that you know of secret paths, alternative routes and hidden entrances and passageways in the most unlikely of places. You may grant advantage to an ally on any one ability check related to one of the journey roles (Guide, Scout, Hunter or LookOut) by describing how your knowledge of obscure places and secret lore aids you. For example, you might lead the Company down a hidden valley when serving as Guide, or discover a secret dwarf-door as a Scout.</p>
			<p>The paths you take often have their own perils or encounters; often, this ability takes you out of the frying pan and into the fire. You may only use this ability once per Adventuring phase.</p>

			<p>At 13th level, you may make preparations in advance and only reveal them when the time is right. Once per Adventuring phase, you may activate this ability and describe actions you took in the past that were unknown to the rest of the player-heroes, but that have now come to light. You must then make a suitable skill check to determine how successful these preparations were. The Loremaster is entitled to veto any unreasonable suggestions.</p>
			<p>Example uses of this ability might include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>“I found this ancient map on another adventure, and I reveal it now.”</li>
				<li>“I sent word to our allies in Rohan a week ago, and they are going to arrive to bolster our defences just before the Orcs attack.”</li>
				<li>“I guessed the King would imprison us, which is why I bribed the jailer a week ago to hide a key behind this loose brick.”</li>
				<li>“I just happened to bring along these fireworks.”</li>

Habits of the Wise is itself only usable once per Adventuring phase.</p>

If you do so, in addition to the lore you learn, you have advantage on any subsequent ability checks directly regarding that person, object, location or event for the rest of the Adventuring phase.

If successful, you may give a short but irresistible command to your target. For example:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Ancient lore: </b>Command a door made by the Elves of Eregion to open.</li>				
				<li><b>Birds and Beasts: </b>Order a fearsome wolf to fly back to its den.</li>
				<li><b>Dark Knowledge: </b>Command a wraith to return to its tomb.</li>
