		<description>
			<p>Inquisitiveness and curiosity are desirable virtues in an individual, but knowledge can be put to malicious use and learned individuals can look down on others as ignorant fools. Secrets are dangerous, as the very desire of uncovering them may corrupt the heart.</p>

	<element name="Shadow Weakness, Curse of Vengeance " type="Class Feature" source="Willem" id="ID_WILLEM_AIME_CLASS_FEATURE_SHADOW_WEAKNESS_CURSE_OF_VENGEANCE">
		<description>
			<p>Individuals who live by the sword are ever tempted to draw it, either literally or figuratively, when their will is thwarted or when they deem their honour to have been impugned by an insult.</p>
			<p>As corruption spreads in the hero’s spirit, their behaviour worsens, leading to more extreme violent reactions.</p>

	<element name="Shadow Weakness, Dragon-sickness" type="Class Feature" source="Willem" id="ID_WILLEM_AIME_CLASS_FEATURE_SHADOW_WEAKNESS_DRAGON_SICKNESS">
		<description>
			<p>Adventurers who find themselves on the road to seek lost riches run the risk of catching the age-old disease capable of turning a pile of enchanted gold into bitter ashes. As the Shadow tightens its grip on their hearts, the world shrinks around them and their closely guarded possessions.</p>

	<element name="Shadow Weakness, Lure of Power" type="Class Feature" source="Willem" id="ID_WILLEM_AIME_CLASS_FEATURE_SHADOW_WEAKNESS_LURE_OF_POWER">
		<description>
			<p>When a man is given a position of authority, either by rank, lineage or stature, he may end up mistaking his own wishes for those of the people he should be guiding or keeping safe. Power is the quintessential temptation, and provides the Shadow with an easy way to win the hearts of those who desire it.</p>

	<element name="Shadow Weakness, Wandering-madness " type="Class Feature" source="Willem" id="ID_WILLEM_AIME_CLASS_FEATURE_SHADOW_WEAKNESS_WANDERING_MADNESS">
		<description>
			<p>Wandering without ever really settling down might be the destiny of most adventurers, but it carries the risk of never finding something to live for. The road goes ever on and on, it’s true, but whither then?</p>
